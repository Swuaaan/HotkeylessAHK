## Hotkeyless AutoHotkey

The **AutoHotkey**(AHK) environment is a *powerful tool* to enhance your productivity and *speed up your workflow*. There are so many possibilities and use cases that sometimes... you might *run out of hotkeys*. Or you might want to *combine* AHK-scripts or trigger them from different sources (e.g. a [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/gaming/stream-deck)).

Until now, you had only *two possible solutions*:

- **Exotic key combinations**, like... `CTRL + ALT + F13`. This solution is **fast**, but not very scalable. You might not remember, which hotkeys are still available and sometimes encounter bad side effects with your favorite software
- **Single AHK-scripts**, which you run directly from AHK or the explorer window. This solution is **scalable**, but how can you life with about *one second* delay, while the AHK-process is starting up?

**Hotkeyless AutoHotkey** combines the best of both worlds. It's an easy way to expand your AHK-possibilites and both **fast** and **scalable**. But don't take my word for it, here are some numbers:

| Approach                | Delay  | Fast | Scalable |
| ----------------------- | :----- | :--: | :------: |
| Key combinations        | 6 ms   |  âœ”   |    ðŸž­     |
| Single AHK scripts      | 780 ms |  ðŸž­   |    âœ”     |
| *Hotkeyless AutoHotkey* | 104 ms |  âœ”   |    âœ”     |

You can make your own *performance tests*. Just have a look at the `performance-tests`-folder!
